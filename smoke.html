                    The King uses nicotine to hook it's subjects. A substance when hooked it's, to put it mildly, almost difficult to escape. Nicotine is the addictive drug in cigarettes that causes smokers to smoke. Addicted smokers need an insane amount of nicotine over a day to <b>feel normal</b> -satisfy their intense cravings or control their mood. Along with nicotine are a whooping 7,000 other chemicals in a cigarette smoke. cigarette has been tested and known to contain over 60 known cancer-causing chemicals. Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing many diseases and reducing health in general.

                <h5 class="mt-3 head text-center mb-3">A BRIEF EFFECT</h5>
                <p>
                    Smoking causes over 1,200 deaths everyday, not to mention the <b>risk of your lungs being unapologetically black</b>. With every death, approximately two healthy teens or young adults pick up smoking for the very first time.<br>
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smoking leads to limited, subnormal or stunted lung development.</li><br>
                        <li>Smoking leads to premature deaths of 1/3<small>rd</small> of it's consumers. However, most, if not all, will succumb to one or multiple forms of health complications.</li><br>
                        <li>Of course our most dreaded, early signs of heart diseases and stroke are detected, developing of lung cancer.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    With the little effects above many people don't know smoking is more dangerous than drugs and alcohol combined, there are approximately 8 million people suffering from diseases caused by direct smoking, as well as second hand and third-hand smoke exposure.

                <h5>THE ALEXANDRA CHAIN SMOKER</h5>
                <p>
                    Smoking is responsible for six million deaths each year. Of those, 600,000 die from the effects of second hand smoke. This number is expected to increase to 8 million in 2030 if the current trends continue - WHO.<br>
                    Alexandra chain smoker, Mpho Ndlovu, knows this, yet he goes through three packs of cigarettes a day. <b>"I have been smoking since I was 15. it started as just playing with friends in school because we knew we were not allowed to. It was a way of being cool. I got hooked and have been smoking for 40 years,"</b> -Ndlovu.<br>
                    What started as a game became a habit and then an addiction.<br><br>
                    "Smoking helps me when I'm nervous and I just enjoy it. I have tried to stop many times but have failed. I know this might one day kill me but, at this point, there is nothing I can do."<br>
                    "By the last week of the month, I would be out of money and sometimes I have to ask people if I can borrow or take some on credit from the spaza shop. When I smoke, especially on weekends, I drink as well. So the money is never enough. My children get angry because they think I should be using the money on them. I don't know how to stop."<br><br>
                    Ndlovu spends R110.5($8) per day on cigarettes. That's R766.50 ($56) per week and R3,066 ($225) per month and R36,792 ($2,700) per year and R183,960 ($13,500) in five years. If he continues smoking the same number of cigarettes per day for another 40 years, at this current price, he will spend around $100,000 (N36,000,000!) on cigarettes. If invested, he could buy a house.<small> change go remain</small><br>

                There are many reasons why young adults and teenagers begin smoking. Most notably may be the relationship between peers and the development of mutual habits. This is to say, many times an action is practiced by an individual's friends or social group it will then be assimilated and practiced by the individual.<br>
                Basically, if the individual's friends smoke, there is an increased risk that the individual will begin the habit of smoking as well.

                <h5>THE BILLION DOLLAR AD</h5>
                <p>
                    JUST SAYING: Ever noticed that smoking is always associated with the so-called succesful people (-their strategy).<br><br>
                    Our govt. claim cigarette companies are heavly restricted on advertising and yet a survey each year found out that they(cigarette companies) spend billions of dollars in ads, so the billion dollar question will be <b>how are they running this ads?</b> by Social Factors. Social factors also include marketing attraction by cigarette companies. This attraction entices teens and young adults. <b>These marketing efforts are unleashed on us in movies etc., they are to ensure that for every smoker who dies, a new smoker is born.</b> Most people who smoke do so at the age of 18. Social factors may also be subsets of peer pressure, such as the seemingly attractive nature of <b>Celebrities, Musicians, actors, and proffesional athlets -who show or tell us they smoke.</b>

            <p class="mt-3">
                There are also factors like general stress, stress related to school, stress related to relationships, family troubles etc., that may lead to smoking. Many are under the mistaken impression that cigarettes eliminates stress. This is not true. The relief experienced is a momentary release of dopamine. This makes you feel less stress, however, the price, your body is really under increased stress. Your blood pressure and heart rate greatly increase, your muscles tense, your blood vessels begin to constrict, and oxygen becomes less available to your brain and to your body (cells, organs, skin,etc.) The dopamine merely provides a false feeling of stress relief, while the nicotine creates more stress and a greater feeling of the continued need to smoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue, however, is that many individuals around this age (18) end up starting a habit that should have never been started. Yes, everyone has a choice, but there is such a thing as making the wrong choice. Smoking is the wrong choice, and there are numerous reasons why.<br>
                Don't be the kings subject.

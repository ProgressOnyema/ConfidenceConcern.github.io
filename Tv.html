            <p>Growing up he gave us shows like Barney, The Teletubies and of course sesame street. We got older and we wanted to see what the real world was like.</p>
            <p>
                Turn on the tv and flip through the channels there is a good chance you will see the following; Violence, Sex scenes or conversations about the topic, People making bad decisions, Cursing or other verbal obscenities. It's no wonder that as a whole, today's teens appear to be wilder and living more on the edge than generations preceding them when they are watching staggering amount of television, and most of those shows being <b>reality TV.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The so called PG13 &amp; PG16 movies feature intense violence, explicit sex scenes and Cursing without showing us scenes depicting the real-life consequence of this action there by manipulating us by giving us an <b>altered view of reality</b>.<br>
                A 2008 study showed that teens who watch sexual explicit shows are under the ever popular tv manipulation paradigm <mark>Every one does it</mark> and so there are not any significant consequences to it.<br>
                Television has drowned us to the extent that we have no clue about the consequences of the decision we make. it's a sad story.

                <h5>THE TATTOO NORMALIZATION</h5>
                <p>As of the concept of this blog, There are no article on google's front page criticizing tattoos!</p>
                Having tattoos has become increasinly popular among us today. Television has manipulated us and promoted it through an exceptional different types of mediums: influential celebrities, shows, sports, movies etc. In short, it's the <b>NEW COOL</b>. Most of us on tattoos are not aware of the impending consequences because through Television we have been put under the ever popular tv unspoken phrase <b>Every one does it</b>. This is of course just another manipulation of the media.

            <div class="mt-3">
                Television has influenced our culture, television now produces, mantains, repairs and transforms our reality as we know it. Take this quote from one of Tv's pioneer:
                <p class="qoute">
                    "We live in terms of stories we tell- stories about how things exist, stories about how things work and stories about what to do-and television tells them all through news, movies, ads to almost everybody most of the time."
                </p>
                We should all think it's suicide when we are educated by Tv and believe every thing we see on our led or silver screen.<br>
                The average person watches almost three hours of television per day, which exposes them to thousands of images of violence, sexuality and advertising, according to a 2001 article in the medical journal "Pediatrics." By the time today's teens turns 70 years old, they would have watched between seven and 10 years worth of television during the course of their lives. The content and amount of television teens watch replaces other activities and could have a negative influence.

                <h5>George Gebner's Three B's of Television</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Television <b>BLURS</b> the clear traditional difference of the people's view of their world.</li>
                    <li>Television <b>BLENDS</b> people's realities to the cultural mainstream (mainstream - ideas that are thought to be normal because they are shared by most people)</li>
                    <li>Television <b>BENDS</b> that mainstream reality to it's own and it's sponsors' intitutional interests.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    (Gebner and his collegues. 1990, p. 261)<br>
                    That's the power of Tv!

            <h5 class="mt-4 head text-center">THE MANIPULATION FORMULA</h5>
            <div class="mt-3">
                <p>
                    Social cognitive theorists stated that television influences human behaviour in two ways, <b>imitation</b> and <b>identification</b>, these two patterns are product of the following interesting process:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Observational learning</b>: Observers can aquire(learn) new behaviours simply by seeing those behaviours performed. Many of us who have never fired a handgun can do so because we've seen it done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Inhibitory Effects</b>: Seeing a model, a movie character, for example, punished for a behaviour reduces the likelihood that the observer will perform that behaviour. In the media we see good samaritans sued for trying to help someone and reduces our willingness to help in similar situations. That is inhibited by what we've seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Disinhibitory effects</b>: Seeing a character rewarded for prohibited or threatning behaviour increases the likeihood that the observer will perform that behaviour, this is the basis for complaints against disney's megahit <b>Moana</b> and the glorification of crime and drugs in movies, for example. Behaviours that people will not adhere to, those that are inhibited now becomes more likely to occur.

                Well it might seem impossible to break away from being a subject to the king, the trick is just to:<br>
                Remind yourself thats it's just Tv an expression of the producers and directors creative imagination and not entirely a dipiction of reality. Drinking won't drown away your sorrows or otherwise make you a princess or a crowned prince and certainly no one is punching his/her way through every situation.<br>
                And blacks on tattos to be frank has got to be the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen.<br>
                Television has put considerable amount of pressure on us to conform.<br>
                Don't be the King's subject!
